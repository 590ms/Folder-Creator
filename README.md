# Folder-Creator
You will need python 3.11 to run this program.

You can give it a name or a directory and it will make folders of all the months and dates inside
for example You give it:C:\Users\user1\Desktop\example
it will create a "example" folder and inside it, it will create folders of all the months and inside 
each month's folder it will create folder of all the dates possible in 1 month.
feel free to make a better version of it!
im very new to coding python and im making projects like this for fun and to learn
(you can use the submit button or just press enter)
(ALL FILES NEED TO BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY!!!)
